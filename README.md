# Hi I'm George Umberger ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate low-level programmer who is studying computer engineering. I love working on new projects and learning new skills. Here's a little bit about me:

## ðŸš€ Some of My Projects

### [Heart PCB](https://github.com/GeorgeU04/Heart-PCB)
**Description:** An embedded system design utilizing an ATmega328P microcontroller for the logic. The LEDs are connected to the microcontroller, which will blink the LEDs if the button is pressed using an interrupt. The circuit was designed by me in KiCad.

**Utilizes:**
1. Circuit/Hardware Design
2. Low-Level Embedded C Programming
3. Hardware Interrupts
4. PCB Design Software (KiCad)
   
### [C Strings](https://github.com/GeorgeU04/C-Strings)
**Description:** An implementation of C++ string methods in C without the user having to deal with the memory management. Does not require the string.h library as everything was coded from the ground up.

**Utilizes:**
1. Memory Management 
2. String Manipulation

### [Calculator](https://github.com/GeorgeU04/Calculator)
**Description:** A calculator made in C and Python which uses a C stack to convert a given expression into postfix and then evaluates it. It can evaluate expressions with parentheses and integers with multiple digits. Now contains a very basic PyQt6 GUI with not every button functioning yet. The Python file calls the C functions using the built-in ctypes library.

**Utilizes:**
1. Stack Written in C
2. PyQt6 for GUI
3. Ctypes Library for C Function Calls
4. Postfix Notation
